# supply-chain-insights

## Project Overview
This project showcases an Excel dashboard for supply chain analytics, complemented by a series of SQL queries demonstrating data extraction, aggregation, and analysis techniques applied to a logistics dataset.

## Features
- **SQL Queries**: A collection of SQL scripts to perform various data retrieval and analysis tasks:
  - Retrieval of all records sorted by order date in descending order.
  - Aggregation of total orders per carrier and maximum weight per order.
  - Conditional queries to filter records based on specific criteria.
  - Grouping and having clauses to summarize data.
  - Join operations to merge related data from different tables.
- **Excel Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard in Excel providing insights into supply chain logistics, including total orders, average weight per order, and performance metrics by carrier.

## Installation
No installation is required. To view SQL queries, use any SQL-compatible database system. The Excel dashboard can be viewed with Microsoft Excel.

## Usage
- **SQL Queries**: Navigate to the `SQL_Queries` folder and open individual `.sql` files with your preferred SQL editor to execute or modify them.
- **Excel Dashboard**: Open `Supply_Chain_Dashboard.xlsx` in Excel to interact with the dashboard.
